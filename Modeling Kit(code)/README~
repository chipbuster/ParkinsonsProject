This code is split into two sections. The Functional_Framework code does everything
using functions and commands, and contains a much more exploratory set of codes.
This code was the basis of much of what we did for this project.

The LinTester folder contains the S4 Object-Oriented implementation of some of 
the codes found in the Functional_Framework folder. It primarily implements
n-fold cross validation in an object oriented manner. Additional instructions
on using the LinTester class can be found in the Documentation subfolder
(./LinTester/Documentation/LinTesterInfo.pdf)
