This code is split into two sections. The Functional_Framework code does everything
using functions and commands, and contains a much more exploratory set of codes.
This code was the basis of much of what we did for this project.

The LinTester folder contains the S4 Object-Oriented implementation of some of 
the codes found in the Functional_Framework folder. It primarily implements
n-fold cross validation in an object oriented manner. Additional instructions
on using the LinTester class can be found in the Documentation subfolder
(./LinTester/Documentation/LinTesterInfo.pdf)

In the Functional Framework, we have several Rdata and txt files.
The RData files are primarily from stepwise forecasting and contain 
lists of variables as given to us by the code found in kevinfied stepwise.R
The output txt files are the same thing in text form. To use the functional 
framework n-fold cross validation, set the formula in makemodel()
under modeltools.R (yes, you have to change code), and source Main.R
