Psuedoheaders for R code

In dataextract.R:

        -aliases 'parkdata' to 'pd' (for easier typing)



In UsefulTools.R

        Script file was coded for a lab, and assumes that the data for modeling
        are named "x" and "y", and data for testing are "xdata" and "ydata".

        makepred(model, data=xtest)
            -Returns prediction based on model and data

        mse(model, data, testdata)
            -Calls makepred() to generate prediction from testdata
            -Then compares data to the prediction, and finds the MSE
            -Returns mean(prediction - data)^2 (MSE)

        mae(model, data, testdata)
            -Calls makepred() to generate prediction from testdata
            -Then compares date to prediction and finds MAE
            -Returns mean(abs(prediction - data)) (MAE)

        msein, mseout, maein, maeout
            -Wrapper functions to call the appropriate functions on either
            x and y (in-sample errors) or xdata and ydata (out-of-sample error)

        moo()
            -Because every well-written program needs an easter egg.

In modeltools.R

        makemodel(datain)
            -makes a linear model using the data in (in Main, this data changes
            as different bins are used). Any changes to the model must be made 
            here, or they will be lost during cross correlation.
            -Returns a linear model

        testmodel(model, modelname, x, y, xtest, ytest)
            -Tests input model using various functions (currently 4, this can be
               changed)
            -model is an object of class lm, modelname is a string or variant
            -x and y are the data used to make the model (for in-sample)
            -xtest and ytest are prediction data (for out-of-sample)
            -Returns a 1-row dataframe with colnames of error measure, rowname 
            is the modelname.

        Includes comment section at bottom to capture particularly
        well-performing models.





In crosscheck.R

        makebins(data, numbins)
            -cbinds a vector of random numbers from 1:numbins to the dataframe
            -returns data frame with numbers

        getTestframe(data, targetbin)
            -returns a dataframe of rows which have bin_num matching targetbin

        getMainframe(data, targetbin)
            -returns dataframe of rows which do not have bin_num == targetbin
